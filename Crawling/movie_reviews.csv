M3GAN,Tom Shone,FALSE,Sunday Times (UK),fresh, 3/5 ,"Mar 2, 2023","After quite a long build-up, the film doesn’t provide as much killer-doll action as we deserve, but the scenes we get are highly entertaining."
M3GAN,Paul Mount,FALSE,Starburst,fresh, 4/5 ,"Mar 1, 2023","... Whilst M3gan is a bit too broad to serve as Black Mirror-style ‘cautionary’ tale, its strength lies in the fact that Megan is a machine created by humanity rather than animated by some supernatural entity or other."
The Menu,James Kendrick,FALSE,Q Network Film Desk,fresh, 3/4 ,"Mar 27, 2023",stylish and engrossing and sadistically enjoyable
The Menu,Matt Brunson,FALSE,Film Frenzy,fresh, 3.5/4 ,"Mar 13, 2023",The art of the meal and the consumer’s craving for more more s’more are just two of the topics explored in a far tastier “eat the rich” offering than the overcooked Triangle of Sadness.
The Menu,Filipe Freitas,FALSE,Always Good Movies,fresh, 4/5 ,"Mar 3, 2023",Never the thought and vision of a cheeseburger made such an impression on me. And by this time your appetite should be big for both the food and the movie.
The Menu,Audra Schroeder,FALSE,The Daily Dot,fresh, 3.5/5 ,"Feb 20, 2023","The story, penned by Will Tracy and Seth Reiss, is expertly paced, punctuated by gorgeous title cards announcing the dishes."
The Menu,Bob Chipman,FALSE,Moviebob Central,rotten, 3/10 ,"Feb 15, 2023","Bad pretentious art that thinks it's critiquing bad pretentious art, told exclusively through the medium of food metaphors? ...yay."
Infinity Pool,Victoria Luxford,FALSE,City AM,fresh, 4/5 ,"Mar 29, 2023","While it’s too extreme for blockbuster audiences, Infinity Pool will satisfy those with a taste for the unusual. It also shows Cronenberg is more than a clone of his father."
Infinity Pool,Rich Cline,FALSE,Shadows on the Wall,fresh, 3/5 ,"Mar 28, 2023","Brandon Cronenberg is more focussed on visually arresting imagery than mining the material for something unnervingly resonant. That said, there's a terrific sense of menace."
Infinity Pool,Dulcie Pearce,FALSE,The Sun (UK),fresh, 3/5 ,"Mar 27, 2023","Things all get a bit Clockwork Orange, with the drugged-up gang putting on terrifying masks and breaking into a house to cause horror and pain... Sadly, the movie loses direction, making it more gory than story."
Infinity Pool,Tom Shone,FALSE,Sunday Times (UK),fresh, 3/5 ,"Mar 27, 2023","With its ominous soundtrack and atmosphere of escalating dread, the movie unfolds with the uncanniness of a dream, but something is missing at its core: Cronenberg’s gaze has the glassy imperturbability of his father, David, tricked out..."
Infinity Pool,Kevin Maher,FALSE,Times (UK),rotten, 1/5 ,"Mar 27, 2023","Brandon Cronenberg, son of David, continues to rehash his father’s themes and preoccupations with this wearisome grand guignol body horror about the primal power of, yep, sex, death and reproduction."
Shazam!,Kate Boyle,FALSE,InSession Film,fresh, B ,"Mar 8, 2023","Overall, Shazam! is a fun movie with mature themes sprinkled in. It embraces the camp and humor this character needs to succeed on the big screen, even poking fun at previous DC heroes and films."
Shazam!,Jonathan Garcia,FALSE,Dynamic Duel Podcast,fresh, 4.5/5 ,"Feb 3, 2023","A really warm-hearted film, and I think it works so well because it's all about wish-fulfillment. ... It brought out so much nostalgia and joy."
Shazam!,Wesley Lovell,FALSE,Cinema Sight,fresh, 3/4 ,"Nov 23, 2022","While many of the plot turns are telegraphed in advance and Strong as the moustache-twirling villain is almost laughably over the top, Shazam! is a blissfully simplistic superhero yarn"
Shazam!,Keith Garlington,FALSE,Keith & the Movies,fresh, 3/5 ,"Aug 25, 2022","There is no denying that “Shazam!” has charm and heart. You also can’t help but enjoy the fun and energetic Zachary Levi, padded suit and all. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that the original Captain Marvel (sorry MCU, it’s true) deserved a better movie."
Shazam!,M.N. Miller,FALSE,Ready Steady Cut,fresh, 3.5/5 ,"Aug 18, 2022",Shazam! is a thoroughly entertaining comic book film that never forgets the fun.
All Quiet on the Western Front,Aaron Neuwirth,FALSE,Why So Blu,fresh, 8/10 ,"Mar 28, 2023","It’s a strong effort that serves as a modern companion instead of a remake of the Best Picture-winning film from 1930. And yes, for all the extraordinary work that made this film look spectacular, it is pretty brutal and knows how to leave an impact."
All Quiet on the Western Front,A.S. Hamrah,FALSE,The Baffler,rotten,,"Mar 16, 2023","What has happened to the German cinema? As an anti-war war movie, this tedious, inert remake has no dramatic force."
All Quiet on the Western Front,Jonita Davis,FALSE,The Black Cape (Medium),fresh, 3/5 ,"Mar 14, 2023","The war was brutal and torture, and it was not kind to the boys who desperately wanted to prove themselves to be men. Thus, it’s not wise to try and view this 'All Quiet on the Western Front' from a lens that romanticizes the people represented."
All Quiet on the Western Front,Carla Hay,FALSE,Culture Mix,fresh,,"Mar 12, 2023","Told from a German perspective, this version of All Quiet on the Western Front is the most brutal and harrowing in showing the horrors of World War I. The movie has well-crafted technical assets, but the personalities of the characters are underdeveloped."
All Quiet on the Western Front,Peter Travers,FALSE,ABC News,fresh,,"Mar 10, 2023","Oscar time is ideal for catching up with Edward Berger’s ferocious anti-war epic about young German soldiers dying in WW1 trenches. The German-language film boasts a wow nine nominations, including Best Picture, and tragically its message never gets old."
X,Matt Brunson,FALSE,Film Frenzy,fresh, 3.5/4 ,"Mar 13, 2023","Separately, X and Pearl might not have made my 10 Best of 2022 list; together, how could they not?"
X,Steph Cozza,FALSE,Cinema Vixens,fresh, 5/5 ,"Jan 6, 2023",A gruesome slasher reminiscent of classic horror.
X,Louisa Moore,FALSE,Screen Zealots,fresh,,"Jan 4, 2023","Ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a bloody, gory, rewarding ride."
X,Jared Mobarak,FALSE,"Hey, Have You Seen ...?",fresh, 6/10 ,"Dec 30, 2022","I can give X the benefit of the doubt [with hindsight], accepting it as an entrypoint into a much larger world regardless of how incomplete it ultimately feels on its own."
X,Samuel Leggett Jr.,FALSE,JVS Media & Productions/Team JVS,fresh, A- ,"Dec 26, 2022","X was true to its name, explicit sexual scenes, horrify scenarios & every more on the stories backdrop. But as a horror film Ti West nails it with his touch on horror story telling and worst case scenario perspective for every character it’s a insane ride"
